# Web Crawler Experimentation Project
This project was built upon a former course assignment.
Additional modifications were made after completing the course.  This version of the program can run on a set list of specific websites, likened to the ones used for testing
provided by the course.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Pickle

# How to run the program:
- Simply run the Search_Engine_GUI.py file from your local Python dev setup.
- If you wish to run this program on a specific set of websites, create a file listing the websites in any order.
- Output: A pkl file will be generated once the crawler has completed its execution.  There you can view word frequencies and most related sites hierarchy.
